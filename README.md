# Bye bye Jess! 🙋‍♀️🙋🙋‍♂️
Well, this is sad moment for us, sad moment for the world. We have mixed feelings - sad, because we will not see you on stand-ups and happy that you have new opportunity and new adventure! :)

Last task for you is to test this application. This is new secret Tandem project, so it is not in JIRA (so don't tell it on stand-up, that you worked on that 😅 )

## Steps for you:
  1. Check the `package.json`, start server and check if everything is OK. 
  2. It would be nice to run cypress test here - you know the drill - `yarn cypress` and check if test pass. 
  3. If not, please fix the code and create PR :) ❤️🤟
